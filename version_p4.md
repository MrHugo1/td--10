- ✅ Mill processing: 8s → 6s (better flow)
- ✅ Bakery processing: 12s → 10s (optimized)
- ✅ Debuff trigger: 30s → 20s (faster feedback)
- ✅ UI render interval: 1s → 0.5s (smoother updates)

### 3. Enhanced Debug HUD
- ✅ Upgrade priority recommendations
- ✅ Performance metrics display
- ✅ Real-time load monitoring
- ✅ Debuff status indicators
- ✅ Resource efficiency tracking

### 4. UI Polish & Modernization
- ✅ Gradient background with glassmorphism effects
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Hover effects and visual feedback
- ✅ Pulse animation for ready crops
- ✅ Shake animation for debuffed silos
- ✅ Responsive design improvements

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Separated game logic and UI rendering intervals
- ✅ Optimized DOM queries and updates
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Efficient state management
- ✅ Memory usage optimization

## Game Balance Changes:

### Timing Adjustments:
- **Wheat Growth**: 10s → 8s (25% faster)
- **Mill Processing**: 8s → 6s (25% faster)
- **Bakery Processing**: 12s → 10s (17% faster)
- **Debuff Trigger**: 30s → 20s (33% faster feedback)

### Contract Balancing:
- **Bread Required**: 15-45 (balanced range)
- **Coins Reward**: 30-120 (scaled rewards)
- **Pipe Parts**: 1-3 (consistent progression)

### Performance Settings:
